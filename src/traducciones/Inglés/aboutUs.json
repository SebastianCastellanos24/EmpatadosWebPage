We managed to register it in 2021 in the Camara de Comercio de Bogota and we continue working so that more children receive quality education.",
        "gratitude-description-2": "We created a new project, strengthened the educational content and made alliances with other organizations that, like us, believe in the power of education to transform lives. All of this we have achieved with small donations from the team members themselves.",
        "gratitude-description-3": "By 2022 we want to continue consolidating processes, make alliances and open doors to pilot a project in Guajira, Colombia. We are taking slow steps but forging the roots of a beautiful mission.",
